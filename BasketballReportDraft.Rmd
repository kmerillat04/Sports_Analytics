# Introduction

This report evaluates NBA player performance using data obtained through
**nbastatR**. The goal is to determine whether players on a chosen NBA
team contributed above or below league-average performance during the
most recent season.

The structure mirrors the baseball and football evaluations:
1. Data and Preparation
2. Modeling Approach
3. Results
4. Interpretation and Evaluation
5. Conclusion

# Data and Preparation

Start by selecting an NBA team to analyze. Retrieve the roster and
player-level statistics for that team.

Load required packages and data. (Shown in pseudo-code style, matching
your preferred format.)

> Load packages: nbastatR, dplyr, tibble, ggplot2, broom

Using **nbastatR**, retrieve season statistics.

> nba_data <- nbastatR::seasons_players(player_stats = TRUE, seasons = 2024)

Create team-level summaries.

> team_stats <- nba_data |> + filter(teamName == "TeamName") |> +
> summarise_all(mean)

Create league-wide averages for comparison.

> league_stats <- nba_data |> + summarise_all(mean)

Next, gather individual player data. Example code (pseudo-format as
requested):

> player_info <- nba_data |> + filter(namePlayer == "Player Name") |>
> select(points, assists, rebounds, efficiency)

Scale each player's statistics relative to league averages.

> player_scale <- (league_stats$efficiency - player_info$efficiency) /
>                  league_stats$efficiency

Apply this scaling to create adjusted team statistics.

> adjusted_team <- team_stats * player_scale + + select(player_info, everything())

---

# Modeling Approach

Build a regression model to estimate player contributions based on
standard NBA box score variables.

> model_eff <- lm(efficiency ~ points + assists + rebounds,
>                 data = nba_data)

Predict how much a player contributes above or below league averages.

> predict(model_eff, newdata = adjusted_team) -
>   predict(model_eff, newdata = league_stats)

# Results

```{r nba_results, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Placeholder example table (replace with real nbastatR results)
nba_table <- tibble(
  FirstName = c("Player1", "Player2"),
  LastName = c("Last1", "Last2"),
  PredictedValue = c(1.23, -0.54)
)

kable(nba_table, caption = "NBA Player Performance Predictions") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

---

# Interpretation and Evaluation

Players with **positive predicted values** contribute above the league
average (based on the chosen efficiency or scoring metric). Negative
values suggest below-average contributions.

Because basketball performance depends heavily on role, minutes played,
usage rate, and team dynamics, these predictions should be considered
alongside contextual factors.

# Conclusion

This NBA evaluation replicates the analytical structure used for
baseball and football—combining pseudo-coded data preparation, modeling,
and prediction to estimate whether individual players helped their team
beyond league-average expectations. This framework can be extended to
multiple NBA teams or integrated into multi-sport analytics projects.
