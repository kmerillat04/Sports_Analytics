# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to evaluate whether the **Cincinnati Reds** 
made effective roster decisions for the 2024 season by examining players' 
**Runs Above Average (RAA)**. This measure helps determine whether keeping 
or signing a player contributed positively to the team's offensive run 
production. The analysis uses R, player-level statistics, and models that 
estimate how individual contributions compare to league-wide averages.

The report follows these sections:
1. Data and Preparation
2. Modeling Approach
3. Results
4. Interpretation and Evaluation
5. Conclusion

# Data and Preparation

The first step in the analysis is to decide which team to examine and gather 
its current and previous season rosters. For this project, the Cincinnati 
Reds were selected.

To begin, load all necessary packages and datasets. (Shown in pseudo-code 
as written.)

> Load packages: baseballr, broom, dplyr, ggcorrplot, ggplot2, Lahman, 
> lubridate, mgcv

To compare individual team players to the overall MLB environment, you must 
construct a league-wide dataset. For this report, data from 2010 onward was 
used.

> df_teams <- tibble(Teams) |> + filter(yearID >= 2010) |> +
> mutate(X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR,
>        BB_HBP = BB + HBP) |>
> select(yearID, R, X1B, X2B, X3B, HR, BB_HBP)

Next, create a table representing the average MLB team performance.

> avg_team <- df_teams |> + filter(yearID = 2024) |> + summarise_all(mean)

A separate table is needed for average outs per team.

> avg_outs <- Teams |> + filter(yearID == 2024) |> + summarize(outs = mean(IPouts))

Now, move on to individual player analysis. For each player, begin by 
retrieving their basic information.

> playerInfo(nameLast = "Benson")

Be sure to record each player's `playerID`, which is used later.

Example: Benson's ID is "bensowi01".

Create a tibble for each player using their playerID.

> benson <- tibble(Batting) |>
> filter(playerID == "bensowi01", yearID == 2024) |>
> mutate(X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR,
>        BB_HBP = BB + IBB + HBP,
>        Outs = .982*AB - H + GIDP + SF + SH + CS) |>
> select(yearID, R, X1B, X2B, X3B, HR, BB_HBP, Outs)

Each player's performance must be scaled relative to team averages.

> benson_scale <- (avg_outs$outs - benson$Outs) / avg_outs$outs

Use this scale to adjust MLB averages.

> avg_team_w_benson <- avg_team * benson_scale + +
> select(benson, yearID, R, X1B, X2B, X3B, HR, BB_HBP)

# Modeling Approach

A regression model is needed to estimate team runs based on the statistical 
predictors included in the dataset.

> lm_runs <- lm(R ~ . - yearID, data = df_teams)

This model will later be used to estimate the runs above average that each 
player contributes.

To compute this, apply the model to the scaled-and-adjusted player data.

> predict(lm_runs, newdata = avg_team_w_benson) -
>   predict(lm_runs, newdata = avg_team)

A positive value indicates the player likely contributes above-average runs; 
a negative value suggests the opposite.

# Display table

```

# Interpretation and Evaluation

Based on the model predictions, players with **positive** predicted values 
are projected to contribute **more runs than an average MLB player**. These 
players appear to be strong assets offensively. Those with **negative** 
predictions may not contribute as effectively to run scoring, suggesting the 
team might consider replacing or re-evaluating them.

While the RAA estimate provides a valuable signal, roster decisions also 
include many additional factors such as defensive ability, contract terms, 
in-game situational roles, and long-term player development. This analysis 
focuses only on offensive contributions through predicted runs.

# Conclusion

This report analyzed Cincinnati Reds players’ offensive contributions using 
pseudo-coded data preparation steps, scaling adjustments, and regression-based 
predictions of team run production. By interpreting these predicted run values, 
we can better understand whether individual players added value above the MLB
average during the 2024 season. The structured framework used here can be 
extended to other teams or adapted to similar evaluation processes in football 
and basketball for future work.
